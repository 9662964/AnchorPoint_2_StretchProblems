 ## Number Printer
 ### Instructions
 - Create a function that takes a single digit `Int` as a parameter and prints it to the console the way an old-school alarm clock would look. You may create auxiliary functions if needed.
 - For example, if you pass 2 the console might look something like this:
 ```
  ---
     |
  ---
 |
  ---
 ```
 - If you pass 8 the console might look something like this:
 ```
  ---
 |   |
  ---
 |   |
  ---
 ```
 ### Black Diamond ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž
 - Modify the function to take an `Int` with multiple digits and print each number in the same fashion on a single Line.
 - For example, if you pass 257 the console might look something like this:
 ```
  ---   ---  ---
     | |        |
  ---   ---     |
 |         |    |
  ---   ---     |
```
